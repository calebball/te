# Té

Té is a simple modal text editor for the terminal.

This was written primarily as a first experiment in writing an interactive application (which is a new concept for me,) and possibly to serve as a platform for future experiments.
It only barely counts as usable currently, implementing only the most basic forms of navigation and insertion, and interacting with just a single file.
